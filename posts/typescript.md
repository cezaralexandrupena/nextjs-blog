At first sight and for a newbie developer, the word **safer** quickly reminds of the potential vulnerability to hackers -or, at least, that was my impression-.

Turns out that, because typescript is compiled to javascript in the end, and according to some testimony on [https://dev.to/akashshyam/to-typescript-or-to-not-3ad0](https://dev.to/akashshyam/to-typescript-or-to-not-3ad0), the safety provided is type-safety and a *theoretical* early bug spotting.

In conclusion, if you're a new developer but have the nerve to stress over bugs for hours on end and actually enjoy it, like me, there really is no practical use for typescript any further than what javascript itself offers. I strictly recommend reading that article and specifically the comment by JoelBonnetR [https://dev.to/joelbonetr/comment/1gj3d](https://dev.to/joelbonetr/comment/1gj3d)
